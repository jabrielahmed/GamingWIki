It''s important to\r\n				know how each of these will affect your character, especially when picking a starting class and viewing equipment.<br><br>\r\n				We can break down these stats into two groups: primary attributes, secondary attributes.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<img src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/siegmeyer.jpg" alt="fat knight" height="100">\r\n			<h2>Primary Attributes</h2>\r\n			<p style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				These stats are what you will be building throughout the game; slowly growing stronger and pouring the souls you collect\r\n				into these attributes. A firm understanding of how these affect your character is important, since you can''t undo any\r\n				choices here and your starting class already has some stats allocated for you. First we need to talk about your level.\r\n				<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Level</span><br>\r\n				Your level is a general indication of how powerful your character is and increases every time you increase a primary\r\n				attribute. To level up, you simply need to spend souls at a bonfire and allocate them to the attributes that you want. As you\r\n				level up, the game requires you to spend more and more souls for each level, meaning that as the game progresses, your\r\n				character becomes less and less flexible. You will be very set in your ways by the end of the game. Your level is also used\r\n				to match you with other players in the game''s cooperative and competitive multiplayer features.  You will generally be\r\n				matched with players that are around your level.<br><br>\r\n				Now we talk about the stats you can manually upgrade.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Vitality</span><br>\r\n				Vitality determines how many health points your character has and is generally useful for all characters. If your character\r\n				is dying to only a few hits, a larger health pool can make you sturdier and allow you more leniency for tactical errors.\r\n				<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Attunement</span><br>\r\n				Attunement simply determines how many sorceries, miracles, or pyromancies you can "equip" at any given time. Note that the\r\n				actual number of slots is only derived from attunement, and ranges from 0 to 10. This means that once you''ve reached enough\r\n				attunement\r\n				for, as an example, 4 slots, you shouldn''t be pouring more points into attunement unless you plan on reaching 5 slots, because\r\n				otherwise you''re just wasting points. Be aware that some of the more powerful spells require more than 1 slot to equip. Here\r\n				is a simple table showing each of attunement''s derived slot values.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<table style="border-style: solid;border-width: thin;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">\r\n			<tr>\r\n			<td>Attunement</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>23</td><td>28</td><td>34</td><td>41</td><td>50</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			<tr>\r\n			<td>Spell Slots</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td>\r\n			</tr>\r\n			</table>\r\n			<p style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Endurance</span><br>\r\n			Your endurance will affect two very important stats and one less important stat. It increases the number stamina points you have,\r\n			meaning that you can run, roll, block, and swing your weapon more often before becoming fatigued. This is great, because once\r\n			you''ve become fatigued, you''re helpless against an opponent''s swing. Endurance also affects your equip load, which is essentially\r\n			how much your character can carry. The more you can carry, the faster you can move around while having heavy items equipped; such\r\n			as swords, shields, and your armor. Equip load has a big impact on your character, which is why you should be sure to read about\r\n			it in the secondary attributes section. Lastly, endurance raises your bleed resistance. Bleed damage often accompanies a blow\r\n			from a very sharp weapon or maybe even a monster''s claws. Overall, you shouldn''t be building your character based on these\r\n			resistances because A) the situations where resistances are useful are inherently situational and if you''re having trouble in\r\n			those situations, you can easily just equip resistant armor or items, and B) you gain resistances naturally from leveling up, and\r\n			since resistance stats suffer from diminishing returns, by the time you reach the end of the game, none of the extra points you\r\n			allocated to resistances will have much of an effect, if any. I''ll bring up resistances again when we talk about the attribute\r\n			called resistance.<br><br>\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Strength</span><br>\r\n			Strength allows you to meet the strength requirement of certain weapons. Most weapons also have a proficiency rating, like D or\r\n			A, which tells you how much your strength is going to improve that weapons damage.  So if you have a lot of strength, say 40,\r\n			then a weapon with A weapon scaling is going to much better for you than a weapon with D weapon scaling. Also, two-handing a\r\n			weapon effectively increases your strength by 50%, allowing for more damage and making it easier to meet a weapon''s strength\r\n			requirement.<br><br>\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Dexterity</span><br>\r\n			Dexterity works in pretty much the same way as strength. Having it allows you to meet a weapons dexterity requirements, and\r\n			having more of it will increase its damage, depending on that particular weapon''s dexterity scaling. Dexterity will also\r\n			marginally increase your spell casting speed, though I wouldn''t recommend putting points into dexterity for that reason alone.\r\n			<br><br>\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Resistance</span><br>\r\n			The attribute called resistance, has the effect of increasing your physical and flame defense, as well as your poison resistance.\r\n			Each of these benefits are completely marginal and <i>I would not recommend putting any points into resistance.</i> The\r\n			reason why is because physical defense, flame defense, and poison resistance all suffer from diminishing returns; so once you\r\n			reach the end of the game, all of the points you invested into resistance would have been a complete waste.  The effect they\r\n			will have on your character will be completely unnoticeable. Also, if you feel inclined you to increase your flame defense or\r\n			poison resistance for a particular enemy or environment, it''s much cheaper to simply equip some resistant gear for your particular\r\n			situation; that way you''re not wasting precious level ups.<br><br>\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Intelligence</span><br>\r\n			Intelligence increases the damage of your sorceries (not miracles or pyromancies) depending on the scaling of your catalyst,\r\n			and having enough of it will allow you to meet the intelligence requirement of said sorceries. A few weapons also have\r\n			intelligence scaling as well, making them great for any sort of melee/caster hybrid character. You can also modify most weapons\r\n			via ascension to give it some intelligence scaling regardless of the weapon''s original characteristics.<br><br>\r\n			<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Faith</span><br>\r\n			Faith works very similarly to intelligence. It increases the power of your miracles and allows you to meet the requirements of\r\n			said miracles. It also has the added bonus of marginally increasing your magic defense. Some weapons also come with faith\r\n			scaling and you always give a weapon faith scaling via ascension.<br><br>\r\n			</p>\r\n			<h2>Secondary Attributes</h2>\r\n			<p style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;"> Secondary attributes are basically just stats that you don''t directly control, but which are influenced by your primary\r\n			  attributes and other sources.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Health</span><br>\r\n			  Your health comes from vitality and is represented by the red bar on the upper-left part of the screen. Whenever you get hit,\r\n			  you lose health and when it reaches zero, you die. You can restore \r\n			  it by resting at bonfires or by consuming items, particularly your estus flask; which refills at bonfires as well.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Stamina</span><br>\r\n			  Stamina comes from endurance and is represented by the green bar in the upper-left part of the screen. This depletes every time you perform an action, like running, blocking, or swinging your sword. When your stamina reaches less than zero, you will no\r\n			  longer be able to perform these actions until it recharges automatically in a few seconds.  This means that it is important\r\n			  to time your attacks and make sure that you are managing your stamina correctly. There are also several items in the game\r\n			  that can increase the rate at which your stamina will recharge, so be sure to look out for those.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Equip Load</span><br>\r\n			  Equip load will determine how fast you move and roll around, as well as marginally determine how fast your stamina recharges.\r\n			  This can be increased by your endurance stat and there are also a few items that do this as well. These character speeds are\r\n			  discrete based on your equip load. To break it down, if your equipment weight is less than or equal to 25% of your equip\r\n			  load, you will be in fastest category and be a very agile fighter. Between 25% and 50% are the medium speed characters, which\r\n			  are still fast enough to dodge almost all attacks. Then there is between 50% and 100%; which can be quite slow. You shouldn''t\r\n			  try for a slow character unless you have the armor to back it up and can plan on taking a few hits or block rather than roll\r\n			  from attacks. If you are over 100%, then your character will become overburdened; they will move very slow, have a hard time\r\n			  swinging their weapon, and collapse when trying to roll. Being above 100% weight is not recommended for any character build. <br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">R/L Weapon 1/2</span><br>\r\n			  This stat simply shows the amount of damage you will deal with the weapon currently equipped in that particular slot. Note,\r\n			  you can always use your fists, so an attack value is still shown for unequipped slots. Also note, magic catalysts and shields\r\n			  also show up here, but it is only showing damage if you would club an enemy with said item, which is not the same as\r\n			  damage from spells that you cast from a catalyst or how much you block with a shield. This damage is calculated based on that\r\n			  weapon''s particular damage default in addition to any scaling it might have with your other stats.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Physical Defense</span><br>\r\n			  Pretty straight forward. The more physical defense you have (most of this comes from your armor), the less damage you take\r\n			  from physical attacks. The game divides physical attacks into three categories: thrust, strike, and slash attacks. Armor\r\n			  blocks each of these types of attacks with separate values. The first number before the three subtypes is actually just\r\n			  an average of the three. It''s fine if you only worry about the average defense, since most melee attack\r\n			  combos are actually a combination of thrusts, strikes, and slashes.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Magic Defense</span><br>\r\n			  Magic defense protects you against magical attacks (go figure). Magic attacks usually have a blue or crystal-like effect.\r\n			  Sorceries fall under this category of attack.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Flame Defense</span><br>\r\n			  Flame defense protects you against flame attacks. Pyromancies fall under this category. Having a shield with a high flame\r\n			  reduction is also very effective against a plethora of enemy types, particularly the final boss.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Lightning Defense</span><br>\r\n			  Lightning defense protects you against lightining attacks. Miracles fall under this category, as well as anything that looks\r\n			  like a lightning bolt or seems electric. Be warned that taking lightning damage while standing in water will deal extra\r\n			  damage to you. This comes into play against a certain chimeara boss.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Poise</span><br>\r\n			  Poise determines how many hits your character can take in quick succession before becoming briefly staggered. If you\r\n			  become staggered against another player, you are most likely going to die. Note that you can become staggered even while\r\n			  blocking. This means that even if you have all of the health in the world and a massive shield to hide behind, you can''t\r\n			  be taking hits forever. You should either try to keep a distance between yourself and hard hitting enemies, or at least wear\r\n			  very heavy armor if you plan on taking a few hits.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  The  following three resistances work in similar ways, in that how much you have of that resistance determines the size of\r\n			  that stat''s resist bar. Whenever you get hit by something that causes bleed, poison, or curse, a meter appears. (Again, the\r\n			  larger your stats, the larger the meter) It will go down slowly, but every time you get hit it will increase. Once it \r\n			  reaches full, you take on that effect. This effect is different for each of the ailments. Note that these ailments\r\n			  can even bypass shields, which makes them very effective against tanky characters.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Bleed Resist</span><br>\r\n			  When your character reaches a full bleed meter, they will instantly lose 30% of their total health. In combination with the\r\n			  stikes needed to reach this much damage, a full bleed meter often means death for your character. Note that causing bleed on\r\n			  an enemy will also damage their health by 30%, though this is capped at a much lower number for bosses. It is still an\r\n			  effective strategy to try and bleed out a boss, since it is usually very easy to attack many times in a row to build up a\r\n			  bleed meter (considering how big and slow some of the bosses are).<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Poison Resist</span><br>\r\n			  Once your poison meter has reached full, it will turn purple and slowly decrease until it has reached zero again. During\r\n			  that time, you will very slowly take damage. Your meter cannot go back up during this process, though you can cure your\r\n			  poison with an item or spell in the meantime. Poison is actually split into two categories: poison and toxin. Toxin is\r\n			  different from poison in that it has its own meter, but is still prevented by poison resist and is still curable. The main\r\n			  difference is that toxin will kill you much faster than poison, so acting quickly and avoiding becoming toxinned\r\n			  is imperative to survival.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Curse Resist</span><br>\r\n			  There are only a few enemies in the game that can curse, but it will surely make it a bad day for you if you do happen to\r\n			  get cursed. After you become cursed (often by standing in some funny looking smoke for too long), your body becomes petrified\r\n			  and you now have only half of your health bar. When you become cursed, it stays with your character even after you die.\r\n			  The only way to become uncursed is to use a purging stone, which can be rare at the beginning of the game, or by finding and\r\n			  talking to a certain NPC. One other side effect is that where you died, you leave a petrified statue of yourself, which\r\n			  other players can see in their own world as a warning. So if you see petrified humans nearby, it means an enemy that can\r\n			  curse you is nearby and you should be wary of your surroundings.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Item Discovery</span><br>\r\n			  Some enemies will randomly drop items based on a list of droppable items; a loot table, if you will. Item discovery increases\r\n			  the odds of those items dropping. It is usually increased by equipable items and by how much humanity you have. It has no\r\n			  effect on combat.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Attunement Slots</span><br>\r\n			  As mentioned earlier in "Attunement", the more attunement you have, the more attunement slots you can have. Most spells only\r\n			  require a single slot, but some may require two. You can "equip" your spells at bonfires, and you can even equip more than\r\n			  one of a single spell; doing so will multiply the number of charges accompanying that spell by the number of copies you have of that equipped spell.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			  <span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Humanity</span><br>\r\n			  Humanity is one of the most obscure stats you have, as well as being the most prominently displayed. In short, it does very\r\n			  little. Humanity in the upper-left corner of your screen is often referred to as "soft" humanity, because you lose it with\r\n			  your souls when you die, and you may lose them permanently if you''re unable to retrieve them. The item called humanity (which\r\n			  we often call "hard" humanity) simply sits in your inventory until you consume it, at which point it becomes soft humanity.\r\n			  You cannot lose items in your inventory if you die, so it is often safest to keep your humanity in this state unless needed.\r\n			  You can use your humanity like a currency at bonfires. With it, you may transform from undead form to human form for the cost\r\n			  of one humanity, or you may kindle a bonfire for one humanity, which you can only do once you are human. Kindling a bonfire\r\n			  increases the number of estus flasks you can max out on whenever you rest at that particular bonfire. Kindling is permanent,\r\n			  even for subsequent playthroughs. Being human essentially opens up much of the game''s multiplayer components. As such, you\r\n			  will be able to invite friendly players to your world, invade other players as a hostile phantom, and hostile phantoms will\r\n			  also be able to invade you. The benefit of summoning friendly phantoms is often weighed against the risk of being invaded.\r\n			  Holding onto soft humanity also increases your item discovery (only up to 10 humanity); this is useful if you plan on\r\n			  "farming" for certain items. <br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			</p>\r\n			<h1 id="bookmark2" style="text-decoration: underline;">Classes</h1>\r\n			<p style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;"> At the beginning of the game, you will have the option of choosing between 10 different starting classes. These classes come\r\n			  with their own starting level and unique stats, as well as unique equipment and spells. Each set feels different, but in the\r\n			  end, you can find items and build your character''s stats however you want. The way your journey starts may not be how\r\n			  it ends. To that end, I want to say that what you choose as your starting class really has no bearing on how you eventually\r\n			  feel comfortable playing the game, and that there is nothing unique about a particular class once you progress enough and \r\n			  have more options available to you. Only for the most committed min-maxers, does picking the "right" class have any real\r\n			  importance. What I would like to emphasize though, is that you should try to choose a class that matches your playstyle.\r\n			  Finding out what you like or don''t like early in the game can let you mold your character efficiently, as well as increase\r\n			  your enjoyment of Dark Souls'' often difficult beginner''s hump. So just choose what looks interesting to you. While\r\n			  talking about each class, I will focus mostly on analyzing the play-style that is most associated with that class, and\r\n			  by my descriptions, hope to be able to match your desired playstyle with the class that corresponds the most with it.\r\n			  Let''s get started.<br>\r\n			  <br>\r\n			</p>\r\n			<h2>Warrior</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/warrior.jpg" alt="A Warrior" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The warrior focuses on melee combat. He has a good balance of quick movement, sturdy armor, and strong attacks.\r\n				No tricks; just fast, tactical, close-range combat.\r\n				I highly recommend this class if you desire the well-balanced melee combat that this game is based on.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Knight</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/knight.jpg" alt="A Knight" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The knight is the tankiest class at the start. He prefers to let his enemies come to him and waits for\r\n				opportunities to strike from behind his sturdy shield. With only a few extra points invested, he can\r\n				also become a solid miracle caster; allowing him to take hits and recover efficiently. His biggest\r\n				downside is that he is also the slowest class. His starting equipment puts him in the greater than 50%\r\n				equip load range, meaning that you probably won''t be rolling away from hits unless you invest\r\n				more into endurance first. He also starts in the "Way of White" coveneat (this makes you less likely\r\n				to be invaded); though this means very little, since all characters can join this covenant right\r\n				away anyways.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Wanderer</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/wanderer.jpg" alt="A Wanderer" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The wanderer plays much like the warrior in that he''s an all around good melee fighter, but he has\r\n				a much larger emphasis on dexterity based weapons and rolling to avoid hits. If you desire a fast\r\n				and formidable combatant with a high level of skill required, then the wanderer is for you.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Thief</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/thief.jpg" alt="A Thief" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The thief is an even further evolution of the the wanderer. The thief almost never attacks head on\r\n				and almost never blocks attacks with his shield. He instead focuses on using special combat moves\r\n				like parrying and backstabbing to subdue their enemies in short order. The thief also starts the\r\n				game with the master key, which allows him to reach many areas of the game earlier than you normally\r\n				would be able to. If you like fighting dirty, then perhaps you should try the thief,\r\n				though be warned that he requires a high level of skill to play well and can take almost no\r\n				direct hits.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Bandit</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/bandit.jpg" alt="A Bandit" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The bandit is another melee fighter but with less armor than most and tends to carry slow \r\n				weapons that deal large amounts of damage in a single hit. He starts the game with meaty\r\n				battle axe, but can easily transition into using weapons that are even larger than himself.\r\n				If you enjoy the thought of pummelling your enemies with a single massive strike, then the\r\n				bandit is the best start for that kind of playstyle. He also starts with one of best shields\r\n				in the game, which allows him to block 100% of all physical and poison damage.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Hunter</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/hunter.jpg" alt="A Hunter" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The hunter classifies as a jack of all trades but a master of none. Rather than focusing on a\r\n				single playstyle, the hunter will try use whatever is best against their current enemy. They\r\n				start with a bow, which allows them to pick off enemies at range before engaging in melee\r\n				combat. Note that you will need to find/purchase arrows as long as you continue to use the bow,\r\n				which can be very bad if you die to enemies repeatedly and are making no progress. Ammo isn''t\r\n				expensive but it''s something to keep in mind.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Sorcerer</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/sorcerer.jpg" alt="A Sorcerer" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The sorcerer is considered to be a powerful and easy class to use. Almost all of your combat\r\n				will be at range thanks to his assortment of powerful sorceries. Their ammo (spell charges) come\r\n				back after resting at a bonfire, so they can often fight like a hunter but don''t have to worry\r\n				about buying arrows. After finding and equipping a large number of spells, you begin to have a\r\n				great number of options when choosing how to engage the enemy. The sorcerer can be quite fun\r\n				to play if you''re the type of person you likes to have a few tricks up their sleeve.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Pyromancer</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/pyromancer.jpg" alt="A Pyromancer" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The pyromancer is much like the sorcerer but focuses much less on outsmarting your opponent\r\n				with magic and more on brute forcing them with powerful pyromancies. Since the power of\r\n				pyromancies as no relation to your intelligence or faith, you can feel free to create\r\n				a strong melee fighter while also carrying with you a strong assortment of spells. The\r\n				pyromancer is perfect for players that want to combine melee and casting into a single\r\n				strong combatant.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Cleric</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/cleric.jpg" alt="A Cleric" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The cleric is another casting class but focuses most on preventing damage rather\r\n				than causing it. To that end, it''s recommended to build your character as hybrid \r\n				melee/caster. It''s still possible to create a strong lightning-bolt throwing caster\r\n				with the cleric, but this type of caster is less versatile than its counterparts and prefers to cast defensive spells to supplement their melee attacks. This class\r\n				is powerful if you have the time to prepare for fights. With about 10 seconds of\r\n				preparation, they can easily become more powerful than any of the other classes in\r\n				a fight. This class is also wonderful to have in a party of friendly phantoms, as\r\n				the cleric can buff and heal his allies, while these allies do the work of defeating\r\n				enemies and protecting the caster. It''s a great cooperative class and also starts\r\n				in the "Way of White" covenant.\r\n			</p>\r\n				<h2>Deprived</h2>\r\n			<p class="classP" style="height: 400px;font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				<img class="classbox" src="http://www.students.uwosh.edu/w/wendlc69/images/deprived.jpg" alt="A Deprived Undead" style="margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 30px;float: right;width: 200px;height: 400px;">\r\n				The deprived is essentially a blank slate. Starting with almost no equipment and\r\n				no special skills, it can be difficult at first; though it doesn''t take long to get\r\n				some armor and a decent weapon. I would only recommend this class if you plan on\r\n				trying a few different playstyles out at first, as he is easily moldable,\r\n				or if you enjoy a challenge.\r\n			</p>\r\n			<h1 id="bookmark3" style="text-decoration: underline;">Starting Gift</h1>\r\n			<p style="font-family: Gotham, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;text-align: left;">\r\n				The game offers you a choice of starting gifts when creating your character.\r\n				These items are mostly not important, and offer nothing that sticks with you\r\n				long-term. This section serves mostly to ease your conscience, by showing how\r\n				you lose nothing by picking the "wrong" gift.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Goddess''s Blessing</span><br>\r\n				This gift starts you off with 3 divine blessings. When consumed, the divine\r\n				blessing will fully heal your character and remove any status ailments (except\r\n				curse). These are great when starting the game, because without much humanity to\r\n				start with, not having enough estus to go around can make exploring quite\r\n				challenging. This is a great gift if you find yourself exploring for long periods\r\n				of time and having not yet found a bonfire yet.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Black Firebomb</span><br>\r\n				Choosing this gift gives you 10 black fire bombs. These bombs are great early in\r\n				the game, and 10 is enough to fully trivialize one of the early bosses for you.\r\n				<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Twin Humanities</span><br>\r\n				Humanity can be especially hard to come by in the early game if you find yourself\r\n				dying a lot. This twin humanity can be consumed for two soft humanity, and really\r\n				helps with kindling those early bonfires.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Binoculars</span><br>\r\n				These binoculars allow you to look at things from far away, which is great for analyzing\r\n				a situation instead of jumping in blind. Note that you can actually find the binoculars\r\n				at the beginning of the game (right next to firelink shrine),\r\n				so I wouldn''t say that starting with is too useful.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Pendant</span><br>\r\n				This item does nothing. Maybe you can take it if you''re feeling sappy.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Master Key</span><br>\r\n				This is probably the most useful item to start with, as it allows you to reach areas of\r\n				the game earlier than you normally should. The thief starts with this automatically as well.\r\n				I wouldn''t recommend this for new players, since wandering into areas you''re not\r\n				supposed to be in yet can often be confusing and lets you get lost very easily.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Tiny Being''s Ring</span><br>\r\n				The tiny being''s ring offers a slight increase in health; about 5%. This is\r\n				useful, but is quickly outmatched by better rings you will find later.<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Old Witch''s Ring</span><br>\r\n				The old witch''s ring, when equipped, allows a special interaction with a certain NPC about\r\n				a third through the game. You can find any of these starting gifts throughout the game, so you\r\n				can still interact with this NPC once you find the ring in-game.\r\n				Other than that, the ring is useless.\r\n				<br><br>\r\n				<span class="subtitle" style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">None</span><br>\r\n				You can always choose to not take a gift, though there is no benefit in doing so.\r\n			</p>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id="footer" style="height: 50px;margin-bottom: 0px;color: #FFFFFF;">\r\n		<i>Manfred Klein''s fonts are free for private, commercial, and charity use.</i>\r\n		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="siteindex.html" style="text-decoration: none;color: inherit;"><span id="siteMap" style="color: #B1B7FB;text-decoration: underline;">Site Map</span></a>\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>', 'How not to die.', 'wendlandt', 'Dark Souls', 'Action', 'PC', 'Praise the Sun!,For Beginners,Beginner''s Guide,', 212, 'Christain,ttttttttt', 'Christain,tttttttttttt', 10),
